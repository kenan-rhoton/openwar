# War

## Good ideas

- Order and Resolution Phase System
- Initial input randomness
- Measured Maneuvers
- Facing important in some cases
- Unit configuration = Unit type + Leader + Equipment options
- No single leader units (but can be monster units or other single models)
- Morale, Exhaustion and Glory
- No ties
- Concept of clashes over actual damage, focusing on the pushing and giving up ground.

## Game order

1. Played on 90x90cm
2. Objectives and terrain
3. Set up one unit alternativley by turns within zone
4. Play rounds until there's a winner.

## Round order

1. Storm phase
2. Order phase
3. Execution phase
4. Resolution phase

## Order list

1. Advance -> Normal move, may shoot or fight before or after it
2. Hold -> Gain bonuses, then shoot or fight
3. Charge -> Move fast towards nearest unit and fight it if possible
4. Retreat -> Move fast away from enemies
5. Run -> Move fast with penalties to ranged and melee combat
6. Special -> Activate a skill

## Unit Types

- Defenders: Hold a position (High Morale and Resilience)
- Breakers: Push into a defended position (High Power)
- Skirmishers: Hit & Run tactics (High casualties but low Morale and Resilience)
- Scouts: Maneuver quickly around the battlefield (High Movement)
- Siege: Force enemy to leave a position (High fear and casualties, no movement)
- Command: Support and give bonuses to army (Important skills)
