# Core Rules

The following rules explain how to play OpenWar.
You may use any type of miniatures as long as you agree with your opponent on what types of units and what options those units represent.
The battle is fought in a series of rounds, in which each player alternates turns to move and fight their enemy.

## Scenarios

Before starting a battle, you will usually pick a scenario to play.
This isn't 100% necessary, you may just decide on deployment zones and rule that whoever completely destroys his enemy first will win.

## Units

Miniatures fight in Units, consisting of one or more miniatures.
Each of those miniatures is considered to have the same stats of the rest of the Unit, except when the specific miniature has an Improvement that differentiates it, as it could be a soldier wielding a Greatsword instead of a Sword & Shield.

It's important to clearly communicate to your opponent exactly which Units you're using and which Improvements they have before play begins.

## Unit Types

There are six basic types of Units, each with a specific focus on the battlefield:

1. Defenders: Units that specialize in holding a position.
2. Breakers: Units that specialize in overrunning a position held by the opponent.
3. Skirmishers: Units that specialize in dealing casualties safely.
4. Scouts: Units that specialize in high movement and adaptability.
5. Siege: Units that specialize in forcing an enemy to leave a position.
6. Command: Units that specialize in keeping your army effective.

An army must have exactly 1 Command Unit at the beginning of the game.

### Unit Improvements

They come in different flavors:

- Equipment: Representing the actual weapons, armor or tools the Unit (or a miniature) carries.
- Skills: Representing abilities the Unit (or a minuature) has.

Improvements will come with a set of different costs:

1. Cost for miniature: cost to apply the improvement to a single miniature
2. Cost for unit: cost to apply the improvement to an entire Unit

Miniatures in a Unit must at all times be within 5cm from one another.
If a Unit becomes split into more than one group, it can only take the Regroup Action until it forms back into a single group.

## Tools

Measuring tape.
A bunch of six-sided dice.

## Measuring distances

You may only do it when instructed to.
Distances between models are measured from the closest point in their bases.

## The Battlefield

90cm x 90cm size, with appropriate terrain.

## Army Setup

Players take turns setting up entire units within their deployment zones until they each have no more Units to deploy.
