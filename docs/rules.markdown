# Core Rules

The following rules explain how to play OpenWar.
You may use any type of miniatures as long as you agree with your opponent on what types of units and what options those units represent.
The battle is fought in a series of rounds, in which each player alternates turns to move and fight their enemy.

## Scenarios

Before starting a battle, you will usually pick a scenario to play.
This isn't 100% necessary, you may just decide on deployment zones and rule that whoever completely destroys his enemy first will win.

## Units

Miniatures fight in Units, consisting of one or more miniatures.
Each of those miniatures is considered to have the same stats of the rest of the Unit, except when the specific miniature has an Option that differentiates it, as it could be a soldier wielding a Greatsword instead of a Sword & Shield.

It's important to clearly communicate to your opponent exactly which Units you're using and which Options they have before play begins.

Miniatures in a Unit must at all times be within 5cm from one another.
If a Unit becomes split into more than one group, it can only take the Regroup Action until it forms back into a single group.

## Unit Types

There are six basic types of Units, each with a specific focus on the battlefield:

1. Defenders: Units that specialize in holding a position.
2. Breakers: Units that specialize in overrunning a position held by the opponent.
3. Skirmishers: Units that specialize in dealing casualties safely.
4. Scouts: Units that specialize in high movement and adaptability.
5. Siege: Units that specialize in forcing an enemy to leave a position.
6. Command: Units that specialize in keeping your army effective.

An army must have exactly 1 Command Unit at the beginning of the game.

Units come with a set of default Options, but more may be purchased at a cost.

### Unit Options

They come in different flavors:

- Equipment: Representing the actual weapons, armor or tools the Unit (or a miniature) carries.
- Skills: Representing abilities the Unit (or a minuature) has.

Options will come with a set of different costs:

1. Cost for 1: cost to apply the option to a single miniature
2. Cost for 10+: cost per miniature to apply the option to *at least* 10 miniatures.
2. Cost for 20+: cost per miniature to apply the option to *at least* 20 miniatures.
2. Cost for unit: cost to apply the option to the entire Unit.

Some Options may not have some of these costs. In that case, they may not be taken except in the costed cases.

## Tools

Measuring tape.
A bunch of six-sided dice.

## Measuring distances

You may only do it when instructed to.
Distances between models are measured from the closest point in their bases.

## The Battlefield

90cm x 90cm size, with appropriate terrain.

## Army Setup

Players take turns setting up entire units within their deployment zones until they each have no more Units to deploy.

# Battle Rounds

# Moving

## Measuring movement

## Terrain

## Running

## Charging

Finishing a run within combat distance of an enemy (5cm) is considered a Charge.
You may not Charge if you are already in combat,
You may Fight immediately after a Charge, with +2 to Push.

## Retreating

Starting a run within combat distance of an enemy (5cm) is considered a Retreat.
You may not end a Retreat within combat distance of any enemies.

# Fighting

A Unit may Fight if it is in combat.
A Unit is considered to be in combat if it is within 5cm of an enemy Unit.

The Unit chosen to Fight may first move up to 5cm with each of its models.
Then, for every miniature in the Unit that is in base to base contact with an enemy miniature, that miniature may Attack the enemy miniature's Unit.

Miniatures with the Second Rank or Third Rank skills may Attack Units if in contact with a friendly miniature in contact with that enemy Unit.

Miniatures with the Third Rank skill may attack an enemy Unit if in contact with a friendly miniature that could attack withe the Second Rank skill.

## Attack Sequence

1. For each friendly miniature do the following:
	1. Choose a weapon carried by that miniature and a target enemy miniature in base to base contact with it.
	2. Hit Roll: Roll the number dice equal to the weapon's Attacks characteristic and add the friendly miniature's Melee to the roll. If the result is equal to or over the weapon's Difficulty characteristic it's a Hit.
	3. Damage Roll: Roll a number of dice equal to the Hits and add the weapon's Pierce to the roll. If the result is equal to or over the enemy miniature's Armor characteristic it's a Wound.
	4. Unless specified otherwise, a Wound kills that enemy miniature.
2. After all friendly miniatures have attacked, make a Presence roll:
	1. Roll 2 dice, adding the Unit's Presence to the roll and the amount of miniatures slain this combat.
	2. If the result is greater than the enemy Unit's Morale, then:
		1. They take a Shaken token
		2. The friendly Unit takes a Glory token
		3. The friendly Unit may perform a Push move against the enemy, moving the enemy Unit up to 5cm directly away from them and then advancing 5cm towards it.

# Shooting

A Unit may not shoot if it is in combat.
A Unit may shoot only at Units that the selected Unit can see.
A Unit may not split shots, except for miniatures with the Specialist rule.
A miniature may shoot only at a Unit within range. A Unit is within range if it is at a distance equal to or less than the weapon's Ranged value plus the miniature's Ranged characteristic.

Resolve each attack as with the Fighting Attack Sequence, except that the Ranged characteristic is used instead of Melee, a Push move is not performed on succesful Presence check and that the attacks are made against the Unit, not specific miniatures. Any Wound taken is assigned by the defender.
